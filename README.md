This is my implementation of NASA's free API https://api.nasa.gov/ for Shopify's fronte-end developer intern challenge 2022.

I have Implemented the basic features into the Mars Rover Photos API which are:
* Display pictures from the API
* Provide a title and like button for each post displayed

I also added a few extra features:
* The likes are saved even when the webpage is closed using localStorage
* There is a navigation menu for each of the 3 rovers currently present in the API
* There is a navigation menu for for each camera in a rover
* You can input what Sol (numbered day since the rover arrived on Mars)
* Error messages are shown with respect to the inability to get the posts from that Sol or the absence of posts on that sol

There weren't much details to put under each post so I concentrated more on navigation. I got information of the project late so I haven't fully tested it. I do however know for a fact that The display of my webpages on a mobile device will not be pretty.

The like and Rocket images were gotten from https://giphy.com/gifs/ and I edited them to my taste on https://ezgif.com/ and https://onlinegiftools.com/remove-gif-background.
